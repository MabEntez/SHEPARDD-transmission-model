Description of the Files:

-----
**SHEPARDD Model.py** contains the annotated code for the classes required to run the individual-based transmission model of cystic echinococcosis.

**Model_Batchrunning.py** contains the annotated code to run the individual-based transmission model of cystic echinococcosis simluations in parallel.

**code_ABC.R** contains the annotated code to fit the model using outputs of the model (SHEPARDD Model.py).

**Model_analysis.R** contains the annotated code to analyse and visualise the outputs of the model (SHEPARDD Model.py).

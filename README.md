# SHEPARDD: An Individual-Based Transmission Model for Cystic Echinococcosis
### Overview ###
This repository hosts the source code for the SHEPARDD individual-based transmission model of cystic echinococcosis. The model is specifically parameterized for a farm setting in Rio Negro, Argentina. It provides a detailed simulation environment for understanding the transmission dynamics of cystic echinococcosis, an infectious disease caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus, which is of significant concern in agricultural settings.

### Repository Contents ###
**SHEPARDD Model.py**: Contains the annotated Python code for the classes required to run the individual-based transmission model of cystic echinococcosis.

**Model_Batchrunning.py**: Features the annotated Python code to execute the individual-based transmission model simulations in parallel, facilitating large-scale analysis.

**code_ABC.R**: This R script contains annotated code for fitting the SHEPARDD model using outputs generated by SHEPARDD Model.py.

**Model_analysis.R**: Provides annotated R code for analyzing and visualizing the outputs of the SHEPARDD Model.py.

**Protoscoleces_cyst_fit.R**: Contains R code to fit the number of protoscoleces per cyst by age, utilizing data and methods from Torgerson et al. 2013.

**Cyst_per_sheep.R**: Features annotated R code for analyzing and visualizing parameters of individual entities from the SHEPARDD Model.py. 

### Getting Started ###
To run these scripts, ensure you have Python (for .py files) and R (for .R files) installed on your machine with the packages used within each script.
